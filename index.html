		<h5><a id="cooling">Cooling</a></h5>
			<p> Central air conditioning helps keep you environment cool and 					reduces humidity levels. As the central air conditioning system 				draws air out of various rooms in your house or business through 				return air ducts, the air is pulled through an air filter, which 				removes airborne particles such as dust and lint. The filtered 					air is then routed to air supply ductwork that carries it back to 				the rooms.
